aiming to:
    - easy to use, enjoyable
    - performant, not crazy performant, but at least
      avoid excesive wasting of resources.
    - works out of the box
    - low usage resource
    - makes sense
    - easy to deploy
    - easy log
    - sqlite3
    - no dumb naming for components. you should be able
      to know what it does by the name, ie, billing.

todo features/ideas
    - task: operations that run in the "background"
      can repeat or not.
    - email: send emails.
    - auth: register, login, google
    - backup: could be a task to be executed.
    - admin dashboard: the idea would be to allow
      admins to see tasks, logs, make changes in the
      database, deploy new versions of the code, 
      update env variables, etc.
    - cli generator: would take care of boilerplate
      code (ie, creating models, etc.)
    - upload new version, and hit deploy from
      admin panel to refresh the new version. use
      symlink to make this happen.
    - before deploy, create backup and allow to
      rollback
